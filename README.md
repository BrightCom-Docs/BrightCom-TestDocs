# BrightCom - Documentation Platform

ðŸš§Note: This is under construction.ðŸš§

Welcome!  This gitHub repository is used to drive and maintain our public documentation platform.  This is done this way to:
 - Ensure we keep our documentation living and always relevant
 - Make it very easy to request clarifications, improvements, or expanding
 - Make it very simple to keep up to date with our solutions

The published site is available here:  https://brightcom-docs.github.io/BrightCom-PublicDocs/

(ðŸš§ __Note: URL Changing as we finish conversion to new documentation platform.__)
